nethack is hard
---------------

**noobhack** does it's best to augment playing nethack. It does anything and 
everything it can to help you along the way to a successful ascension.

how does noobhack help me?
--------------------------

noobhack remembers things about the dungeon that might be otherwise tedious for
you to think about. Found a rare bookshop on dlvl 5 but don't have the money to
pay for the books yet or the time to steal them? nooback remembers features
about the dungeon. 

Just heard a sound in the dungeon, but can't be bothered to check a spoilers
website and check what it means? noobhack translates noises and remembers it.

Standing toe-to-toe with an energy vortex and can't remember if you're shock 
resistant or not? noobhack remembers, and it's only a keystroke away.

Taught yourself a spell, but can't remember when it expires? noobhack's got you
covered.

Know you can price-identify an item, but don't want to keep switching windows
to enter values into a calculator? noobhack automatically price identifies 
items for you as you pick them up.

awesome! how do i get started?
------------------------------

Simple: Start noobhack by typing

    % noobhack

at the command line. This will start a seemingly normal game of nethack. You
can play nethack without ever consulting noobhack, but if you want to consult
the helper console simply press `tab`. To dismiss it press `tab` again. Voila!

does noobhack work on public servers like nethack.alt.org?
----------------------------------------------------------

Yup, you can start a remote game by doing something like:

    % noobhack -h nethack.alt.org

isn't this cheating?
--------------------

Some people might (and I suspect *will*) consider noobhack cheating. However,
before you start chuggin' a gallon of hater-ade, consider this:

* noobhack doesn't actual know anything other than what it sees on screen.
* I spent more time working on noobhack than most people spend ascending.
* ...
* Screw you, it's not cheating!
